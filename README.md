# Add to $PATH - Global ENV in Bash
A linux based executable, thats adds and removes, in one command, the **current folder to $PATH** within bash; making the content of the current folder accessible from anywhere.

Paste [atp.sh](https://github.com/danass/Add-to-path/blob/main/atp.sh) script content to your **~/.bashrc** file.
#### Adding current folder to $PATH 

_user@bash$_ `atp .`

#### Remove current folder to $PATH
_user@bash$_  `atp -r .`


It's that easy!
